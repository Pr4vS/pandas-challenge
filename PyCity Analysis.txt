The charter schools spend less dollars per student while maintaining a higher overall passing scores. When comparing the average of the per-student budget between top versus bottom performance, the top performers, which are all charter schools, spend approximately 40 dollars less per student.  When comparing Top Performing Schools with Bottom Performing schools (By % Overall Passing), the Charter Schools outperformed the District schools by approximately 40 per cent in math and reading.
The school summary finding showed that from 15 schools 7 of them are found at the district level, and the other 8 of them found at the charter level. The number of students in schools ranged between 427 students (Holden High School) to 4976 students (Bailey High School).
The findings from the data showed that in all metrics (average, percent, and overall) of reading and math scores Charter schools have a greater score than District schools. 
Pena High School has the maximum (83.839917) average math score (83.839917), percent of students passing math (94.59%) and average reading score (84.044699). This implies that Pena High School has a good quality, and reputation in teaching math, and reading. 
Huang High School has a lower average math score (76.842711), and percent of students passing math (65.683922). 
Regarding the percent of passing reading class Thomas High School has a higher percentage value (97.30%). Rodriguez High School has a lower Average Reading Score (80.744686), and Ford High School has a lower passing reading. 
In the overall percentage passing Cabrera High School has the maximum passing percentage rate (91.33%), and Rodriguez High School has a lower percentage of (52.98%) passing.
The data also revealed that when the number of students is higher in schools, the average scores, passing scores, and overall passing, all decrease. It can be inferred that, when the number of students rises, it negatively affects student achievement. Therefore, schools, cities, districts, and charters should work on student size in schools, and classes as it directly affects student achievement.
